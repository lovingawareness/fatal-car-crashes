{"name":"Fatal-car-crashes","tagline":"Diving into the data behind signs on Illinois highways that say \"957 TRAFFIC DEATHS IN 2012.\" #peoplenotdata","body":"![Illinois Road Deaths Sign](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tothebeat/fatal-car-crashes/master/roadsign.jpg)\r\n\r\n# Motivation\r\n\r\nYou may have seen a sign like the one pictured above while on the highway in Illinois, displaying how many deaths there have been on the road. The sign above says there had been 957 traffic deaths in 2012. That number is scary, but what does it really mean? Where did they happen and under what conditions? Besides avoiding texting while driving, what else should I be watching out for?\r\n\r\nAs a non-driver myself, and feeling pressure from family to get my driver's license, I feel all the more sensitive to statistics like this. I don't drive precisely because of the risk of accidents. If we were all driving bouncy bubble cars, I would have gotten my license many years ago. I'm still considering getting my license anyway and I'd feel a lot better if I could pinpoint where the really awful accidents happened.\r\n\r\n# Where's The Data?\r\n\r\nDownload ZIP archives of each of the years, from 1975 to 2012, from [my Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B-uK_N5AC6DqUllFM3JvYk93RTQ&usp=drive_web). \r\n\r\nRe-host it somewhere better and tell me about it so I can update this documentation.\r\n\r\n# Where'd The Data Come From?\r\n\r\nThe [National Highway Traffic Safety Administration](http://www.nhtsa.gov/) operates something they call the [Fatality Analysis Reporting System](http://www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov/Main/index.aspx), which provides _extensive_ data on all accidents that result in deaths on the roadway. They don't report trauma and death in the hospitals, because at that point it's health information and private.\r\n\r\n\r\n# NHTSA FARS FTP DBF WUT (Getting The Data)\r\n\r\nFARS has data for the years 1975 to 2012 (inclusive). To get data for 2012:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./get_data_for_year_XXXX.sh 2012\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will create a `2012` folder, download a ZIP file from FARS to it, and unzip the DBF files there.\r\n\r\n# DBF -> CSV with Python\r\n\r\nDBF is the [dBASE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBase) file format, and it's as ancient as Time itself. There are several Python modules that read it, but I used [dbfpy](http://dbfpy.sourceforge.net/) because it had the best documentation.\r\n\r\nLet's say you downloaded data for 2012. Here's how you convert the accident list into a CSV file you can open with, well, almost anything:\r\n\r\n```\r\npython dbf_to_csv.py ./2012/accident.dbf ./2012/accident.csv\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Trim The Data\r\n\r\nUmm, that CSV file is 4.7 megabytes and thirty-three thousand rows. That's a bit unwieldly if we want to visualize it on the web. Let's cut it down so we have just\r\n\r\n* The date and time of the accident. Fields: MONTH, DAY, HOUR, MINUTE\r\n* The number of fatalities reported. Field: FATALS\r\n* The geographic location. Fields: LATITUDE, LONGITUD\r\n\r\nTo trim accident.csv from the previous step into something a little more manageable:\r\n\r\n```\r\npython simplify_csv.py ./2012/accident.csv ./2012/accident_simplified.csv\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe new file is still thirty three thousand rows but it's about 25% its former size at 1.2 megabytes.\r\n\r\n# Do Something With It\r\n\r\nTry uploading to [CartoDB](http://cartodb.com/visualize) or [Google Fusion Tables](http://www.google.com/drive/apps.html#fusiontables) to map this data and explore.\r\n\r\nCheck out what the 2012 data looks like below.\r\n\r\n## CartoDB Visualize\r\n\r\n[![CartoDB Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tothebeat/fatal-car-crashes/master/cartodb_screenshot.png)](http://cdb.io/1cagt7b)\r\n\r\n## Google Fusion Tables\r\n\r\n[![Google Fusion Tables Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tothebeat/fatal-car-crashes/master/fusiontable_screenshot.png)](https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?docid=1HSmnbonscs8FbUkrVqr6vPiZFsNR02P_PaRqDNY)\r\n\r\n# People, Not Data\r\n\r\nWe should not let the numbers go to our heads. After all is said and done, there were still at least 33000 violent and assuredly unexpected deaths of people in 2012. That's like the population of a township just dying tragically in one year. It's mind-boggling. I struggle to comprehend or describe that kind of loss.\r\n\r\nPlease read Jake Solomon's essay [People, Not Data](https://medium.com/p/47434acb50a8).\r\n\r\n# Setup on PythonAnywhere\r\n\r\nYou can create a free account on [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) and get access to a bash console and an [IPython](http://ipython.org/) shell in just a few minutes. It's a great way to experiment with Python and git without investing time and energy into creating a development environment.\r\n\r\nIf you're just creating an account now, choose the option to clone and work on a Github repo. Otherwise, go to your Dashboard and open a bash console. In the console, clone this repository:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/tothebeat/fatal-car-crashes.git\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you have trouble copy and pasting into your console, read [their guide on that](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/wiki/CopyAndPaste).\r\n\r\nChange directory into the new clone and run the setup script to create a Python [virtualenv](http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/) and install the requirements:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd fatal-car-crashes\r\n./setup.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `accident.dbf` file for 2012 is included in the repository. If you'd like to see how to convert that to CSV, or see how that conversion works, take a look at this from `dbf_to_csv.py`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef dbf_to_csv(dbf_path, csv_path):\r\n    with open(dbf_path, 'rb') as dbf_file:\r\n        database = dbf.Dbf(dbf_file, readOnly=True)\r\n        with open(csv_path, 'wb') as csv_file:\r\n            dict_writer = csv.DictWriter(csv_file, fieldnames=sorted(database[0].asDict().keys()))\r\n            dict_writer.writeheader()\r\n            for record_number, record in enumerate(database):\r\n                dict_writer.writerow(record.asDict())\r\n            print 'Converted {n} rows of DBF file {f}'.format(n=record_number, f=dbf_path)\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Talk to me\r\n\r\nI talked about this project at the [Chicago Python Users Group](http://www.chipy.org/) meeting on January 9:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=MN1y5lvSHQ8\r\n\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/MN1y5lvSHQ8/0.jpg\" \r\nalt=\"IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" border=\"10\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI also regularly attend the [Open Gov Hack Night](http://opengovhacknight.org/) in Chicago, which is held at 6pm every Tuesday at 1871 in the Merchandise Mart. Please come say hello to me, I'd love to know what you're working on and what challenges you're facing.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
